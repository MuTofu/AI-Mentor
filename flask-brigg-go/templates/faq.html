    <h4 class="title-faq">1. How does this app works?</h4>
    <p>Once you entered your twitter profile and make sure it is not privated, the machine will analyze your MBTI types based on what you tweeted and results are given based on the analysis.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4 class="title-faq">2. Is this machine accurate?</h4>
    <p>This analysis can be a really good start to determine your MBTI type without getting biased of what MBTI type that you wanted to be, especially if you're new in the theory. Learning the MBTI theory by yourselves and doing a self analysis could result in a more accurate answer considering MBTI theory is much more complex.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4 class="title-faq">3. What is the difference between this machine and questionnaire based MBTI test?</h4>
    <p>With this machine, we hope that it will reduce the probability to manipulate the answers to get a certain MBTI that is more preferable. By getting a more nonbiased answer, we hope that users can reflect to themselves in a more accurate way.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4 class="title-faq">4. How can I learn more about MBTI?</h4>
    <p>This website offers you articles about MBTI! Click the link below to access more information about MBTI in our website. If you need other supporting literatures, you can search other references that are available on the web too.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4 class="title-faq">5. What should I do with my MBTI type?</h4>
    <p>Each person comes with their own strength and weakness. By knowing your MBTI type, you can reflect to yourselves of what aspects that can be improved and what things that you're potentially into. Even your MBTI type can determine what career that you are potentially into or even compatibility with the other MBTI types.</p>
