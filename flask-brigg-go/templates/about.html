    <h1 class="titleAbout">MBTI?</h1>
    <p>a personality test designed to classify individuals according to their expressed choices between contrasting alternatives in certain categories of traits. The categories, based on Jungian typology, are (a) Extraversion–Introversion, (b) Sensing–Intuition, (c) Thinking–Feeling, and (d) Judging–Perceiving. The participant is assigned a type (e.g., INTJ, ESFP) according to the pattern of choices made. The test has little credibility among research psychologists but is widely used in educational counseling and human resource management to help improve work and personal relationships, increase productivity, and identify interpersonal communication preferences and skills. [Isabel Briggs Myers (1897–1980), U.S. personologist, and her mother Katharine Cook Briggs (1875–1968)]</p>
